We train a probabilistic classifier to estimate the likelihood of at least one incident in the next H hours. The model outputs a risk score p∈[0,1]. At inference time, we apply a tunable decision threshold (default 0.8, chosen on a held-out period for F1/precision–recall trade-off) to flag cells as ‘high risk’. This threshold is part of the operational policy, not the model training itself.
